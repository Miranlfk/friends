# friends

Knowing which individuals and companies are involved in the sigstore project and why would benefit the entire Tekton community. This repository acts as a place that allows members of the ecosystem (known as "sigstore Friends") to self-report in a way that is beneficial to everyone.

To make an entry (thank you!), please create a directory for your company and
add a markdown file. Please see `example` for an outline. Make this a pull
request to sigstore/friends
