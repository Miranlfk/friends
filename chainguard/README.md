# Chainguard

* Chainguard, Inc., is an active user and contributor of the sigstore project.
* We actively work on extending usage of sigstore, for example in form of [blogs](https://chainguard.dev/posts) demonstrating how to use sigstore in various environments, how it works, or adding [integrations](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/pull/1295) to other services making it seamless to adopt.
* We also evangelize, and share our experiences in forms of blog posts, speaking engagements, social media, etc.
* We are building services and products for securing the software supply
chain, and we're utilizing all components of sigstore as building blocks of our offerings.
