# Connaisseur

[Connaisseur](https://sse-secure-systems.github.io/connaisseur/) is an admission controller to integrate container image signature verification and trust pinning into a Kubernetes cluster. It is an open source community project driven and supported by [Secure System Engineering](https://www.securesystems.de/).

* Connaisseur integrates the sigstore project as a solution for container image signatures
* Signatures created via cosign/sigstore can be validated via Connaisseur in a Kubernetes cluster
* The Connaisseur (team) is an early adopter of the sigstore project and is happy to contribute to the sigstore community
